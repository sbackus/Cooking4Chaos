Variable naming convention in Twine:
In twine, all food-related variable are named for the complete name of the food item, with words separated by underscores.

For instance, the variable that tracks how much "plain custard" the player has in their inventory is named "$plain_custard". "Plain ice cream" is "$plain_ice_cream". "Mochi" is "$mochi".

These variables will exist for any food type (with plain custard as the example):
$plain_custard - how much plain custard does the player have.
$plain_custard_made - true/false, has the player ever made plain custard.
$plain_custard_recipe - true/false, has the player discovered the recipe for plain custard.
